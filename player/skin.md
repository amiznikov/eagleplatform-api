# Skinning player

## Using common components

You can use some common classes in your skins and plugins to let player appearance be consistent.

* `eplayer-holdable` allows skin to automatically hide elements when neccessary
* `eplayer-skin-pane` draws pane according to player skin styles and colors
* `eplayer-skin-button` will draw button according coloring styles

## Using color styles

Usually using button and pane components is enough to build simple plugin or skin.

However you can use these styles to build more complex interface.

* `eplayer-text-color` will set color property to *text-color* color of player template
* `eplayer-text-color-background` will set background color property to *text-color* property of player template
* `eplayer-hover-color` will set color on hover elements to *hover-color* property of player template
* `eplayer-active-color` will set color property to *active-color* of player template
